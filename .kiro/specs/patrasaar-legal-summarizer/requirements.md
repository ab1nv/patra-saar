# Requirements Document

## Introduction

PatraSaar is a minimal web application that specializes in summarizing Indian legal jargon for ordinary people. The platform provides secure document upload capabilities, automated text extraction, AI-powered summarization, and an interactive Q&A interface. The system is designed as a monorepo with a Next.js frontend, Go backend, and PostgreSQL database, all integrated with a fine-tuned GPT model for legal document processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload and Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely upload legal documents in various formats, so that I can get them summarized and analyzed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL accept .txt, .pdf, and .docx file formats only
2. WHEN a PDF file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL enforce a maximum page limit as defined in the core config file
3. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content automatically using appropriate parsers
4. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL store the document with a unique ID in the database
5. WHEN a document is stored THEN the system SHALL enqueue an asynchronous task to generate the initial summary

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Summarization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a high-level summary of my uploaded legal document, so that I can quickly understand the key points without reading complex legal jargon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a summary using the fine-tuned GPT model
2. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits efficiently to avoid service interruptions
3. WHEN a summary is being generated THEN the system SHALL provide status updates to the frontend
4. WHEN a summary is complete THEN the system SHALL store it in the database linked to the original document
5. WHEN the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and notify the user

### Requirement 3: Interactive Q&A Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask specific questions about my uploaded document, so that I can get targeted explanations about particular legal concepts or clauses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL use the document context with the fine-tuned model to generate relevant answers
2. WHEN processing questions THEN the system SHALL stream responses from the AI model to provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN a conversation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain chat history for the current session
4. WHEN multiple questions are asked THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
5. WHEN a question cannot be answered THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback responses

### Requirement 4: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive single-page interface built with modern web technologies, so that I can easily navigate and use all features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL display a responsive two-column layout
2. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the system SHALL show document text in the left column and summary/Q&A tabs in the right column
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with loading indicators
4. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL follow shadcn-ui design patterns for consistency
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder logo and proper favicon

### Requirement 5: System Architecture and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a lightweight, scalable architecture, so that the application can handle multiple users efficiently with minimal resource consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the backend SHALL use Go for optimal performance and low resource usage
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL use Gin framework for fast API routing
3. WHEN processing background tasks THEN the system SHALL use Asynq with Redis for reliable task queuing
4. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use pgx driver for high-performance PostgreSQL operations
5. WHEN scaling the application THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through containerization

### Requirement 6: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my legal documents to be handled securely, so that my sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes to prevent malicious uploads
2. WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL use secure database practices with proper access controls
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL be resistant to common web attacks (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
5. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL work effectively with Cloudflare protection

### Requirement 7: Development and Deployment Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive development tools and CI/CD pipelines, so that I can efficiently develop, test, and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide hot reloading for all stack components via Makefile
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute comprehensive test suites for frontend, backend, and database components
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL trigger automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for consistent environment management
5. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation and setup instructions in the README

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable limits and proper monitoring, so that I can control system behavior and track performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN there SHALL be a core config file that defines PDF page limits and other constraints
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL log important events for debugging and monitoring
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and proper error handling
4. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
5. WHEN resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation of services
